    <h1>Beef Stew with Carrots & Potatoes</h1>
    <br>
    <p>This classic French beef stew is the ultimate cold weather comfort 
        food. After a few hours in the oven, the meat becomes meltingly 
        tender and enveloped in a rich wine sauce.</p>

        <li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>1-1/2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour 2 cups dry red wine</li>
        <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1-1/2 teaspoons sugar</li>
        <li>4 large carrots, peeled and cut into one-inch chunks on a diagonal </li>

        <li>Fresh chopped parsley, for serving (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325Â°F and set a rack in the lower middle position.</li>
        <li>Pat the beef dry and season with the salt and pepper. In a large Dutch oven or heavy soup pot, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over medium-high heat until hot and shimmering. Brown the meat in 3 batches, turning with tongs, for about 5 minutes per batch; add one tablespoon more oil for each batch. (To sear the meat properly, do not crowd the pan and let the meat develop a nice brown crust before turning with tongs.) Transfer the meat to a large plate and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the onions, garlic and balsamic vinegar; cook, stirring with a wooden spoon and scraping the brown bits from bottom of the pan, for about 5 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook for a minute more. Add the beef with its juices back to the pan and sprinkle with the flour. Stir with wooden spoon until the flour is dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the wine, beef broth, water, bay leaf, thyme, and sugar. Stir with a wooden spoon to loosen any brown bits from the bottom of the pan and bring to a boil. Cover the pot with a lid, transfer to the preheated oven, and braise for 2 hours.</li>
    </ol>
